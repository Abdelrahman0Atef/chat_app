# Chat App
**The Goal**<br/>
The goal of this app was to learn how to integrate Firebase into my Flutter apps. I revisited my knowledge of Firebase and decided to use Firebase Cloud Firestore to work with a cloud-based NoSQL database, and also used Firebase Authentication to add secure user registration and login methods.

## What I Built
I built a modern chat app where users can sign up, log in, and start chatting with each other.

## The Finished App
In the end, I managed to create a fully functional chat app that works smoothly and without issues.
